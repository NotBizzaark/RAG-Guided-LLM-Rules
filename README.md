# RAG-Guided-LLM-Rules
RAG-Guided LLM Rules – A Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that teaches or enforces custom rules and guidelines for large language models. The system stores policies in a vector database and injects the most relevant rules into the model’s prompt at runtime, ensuring consistent, auditable responses without fine-tuning.
